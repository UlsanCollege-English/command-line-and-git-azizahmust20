My name is Azizah Mustafidah. I am 22 years old. I am currently in my fourth year. I am attending Politeknik Negeri Ujung Pandang to get my multimedia and networking engineering degree. My goal is to become a UI designer. Being a UI designer is not about the beauty of the web or application design, but whether the design that has been created can be implemented or not, is user-friendly or not, and more.
I am at Ulsan College right now and am taking this course because it is still related to my major and my goal. I am not just curious about design, I am also curious how web development can make that happen.
